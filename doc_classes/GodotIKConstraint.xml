		Abstract base class for inverse kinematics constraints.
	</brief_description>
	<description>
		GodotIKConstraint offers a flexible interface for implementing custom constraints that affect how bones behave in an IK chain.
		Constraints can enforce joint limits, simulate realistic joint behavior, or introduce specialized adjustments during the IK solving process.
		Subclasses should override the [method apply] method to define how the constraint alters bone positions and to implement any constraint-specific logic.

			<description>
				Adjusts the positions of bones in an IK chain by applying the constraint.

				Parameters:
				- [param pos_parent_bone]: Position of the parent bone.
				- [param pos_bone]: Position of the bone currently being constrained.
				- [param pos_child_bone]: Position of the child bone.
				- [param chain_direction]: Direction along the IK chain. Use the provided constants [enum GodotIKConstraint.FORWARD] or [enum GodotIKConstraint.BACKWARD] for clarity. Many constraints need only be applied in one direction, allowing for an early return.

				Returns a [code]PackedVector3Array[/code] containing the positions [code][pos_parent_bone, pos_bone, pos_child_bone][/code] for the current bone index.

				[b]Note:[/b]
				- If the bone (referenced by [member GodotIKEffector.bone_idx]) has no parent or child, the corresponding [param pos_parent_bone] or [param pos_child_bone] will be [code]Vector3.ZERO[/code].
				- If the bone has a parent but that parent lies outside the affected chain, the supplied [param pos_parent_bone] is used as provided; however, the first element of the returned [code]PackedVector3Array[/code] will be ignored.

			Indicates that the constraint is applied in the backward pass (from leaf to root) along the IK chain, typically giving greater influence to bones higher in the chain.
