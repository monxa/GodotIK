	<brief_description>
		Provides a robust inverse kinematics solver for 3D skeletal animations.
	</brief_description>
	<description>
		GodotIK is a flexible and high-performance inverse kinematics (IK) solver designed specifically for 3D skeletons.  
		Extending SkeletonModifier3D, it employs the FABRIK IK algorithm to dynamically adjust bone positions and translates these to rotations, resulting in natural movement and smooth pose transitions.  
		Developers can customize the IK process—such as by adjusting the iteration count—to balance solving accuracy with performance.  
		GodotIK expects to have one or many [GodotIKEffector] children.

		<member name="iteration_count" type="int" setter="set_iteration_count" getter="get_iteration_count" default="8">
			Specifies the number of iterations performed during the IK solving process.  
			Higher values typically yield more accurate results but may impact performance, while lower values result in faster computation with reduced precision.
